# Version 0 Code Overview
We are having 3 algorithms, Greedy algo using First Come First Serve  (FCFS), Greedy Algo using sorting (SORT), and a checker dp-brute force algo(Checker.cpp). Right now we have to compare FCFS and SORT algo

## Important Edits
I have only printed the time required by robot to for testing purpose, if you want to check the path, uncomment that part out.

## How to check

### 1) Build all the file using file following compile command
  ```
g++ <name_of_file>.cpp -o <name_of_file>
 ```
Do not change the naming of any file as the all the script.bat file is made using these namings. Most probably you do not have to take care of this thing as most ide already have build command in this way. 
Do this for anything label as .cpp (there are too many files so not writing the whole info)
To Do ==> Probably add a maker process to automate this part

### 2) Run script.bat
```
./script.bat
```

## Edit Instruction
I have made a comparison.cpp file, which if done a brief overview is easy to observe that I used used file stream instead of cin to read different files simultaneously. So to add custom check type, just change the comparison.cpp file.


## ToDo
Adding a maker(for automate building also) might help
